# Chimera Intel ðŸ”±

A modular OSINT platform for comprehensive corporate intelligence and counter-intelligence, powered by an AI analysis core.

## Overview

Chimera Intel is a command-line tool designed to solve a critical business problem: information fragmentation. Inspired by the mythological Chimeraâ€”a creature forged from multiple animalsâ€”this tool synthesizes disparate data streams into a single, unified, and actionable dossier.

It is built to serve two primary functions:
* **Offensive Intelligence:** To gather a deep understanding of external entities like competitors or potential partners.
* **Defensive Counter-Intelligence:** To allow an organization to see its own digital footprint through the eyes of an attacker and proactively identify weaknesses.

## Features

Chimera Intel is organized into several command groups, each with a suite of features.

### SCAN (Offensive Intelligence)
* `scan footprint`: Gathers WHOIS, DNS, and Subdomain information.
* `scan web`: Analyzes a website's technology stack and traffic estimates.
* `scan business`: Retrieves public financial data, news articles, and patent filings.

### DEFENSIVE (Counter-Intelligence)
* `defensive breaches`: Checks for domain-related email breaches via HIBP.
* `defensive leaks`: Scans GitHub for potential secret leaks.
* `defensive typosquat`: Detects potential phishing domains.
* `defensive surface`: Analyzes public-facing assets using Shodan.
* ...and more.

### ANALYSIS (AI & Historical Core)
* `analysis core sentiment`: Analyzes the sentiment of a news headline or text.
* `analysis core swot`: Automatically generates a SWOT analysis from collected data.
* `analysis diff`: Compares historical scans to detect changes over time.
* `analysis forecast`: Forecasts potential future events based on historical data.
* `analysis strategy`: Generates a high-level strategic profile of a target.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/chimera-intel.git](https://github.com/your-username/chimera-intel.git)
    cd chimera-intel
    ```

2.  **Set up API Keys:**
    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (you can copy `.env.example`).
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your secret API keys from the various services used.

3.  **Install the package:**
    This project uses modern Python packaging. The recommended way to install it is using `pip` in "editable" mode within a virtual environment. This installs the `chimera` command globally within your environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the tool from anywhere using the `chimera` command.

```bash
# Get help for any command
chimera --help
chimera scan --help

# Run a basic footprint scan on a domain and save the output
chimera scan footprint google.com --output google_footprint.json

# Check your own company's domain for data breaches
chimera defensive breaches mycompany.com

# Generate a SWOT analysis from a previously saved scan
chimera scan business "Microsoft" --ticker MSFT -o microsoft.json
chimera analysis core swot microsoft.json

### Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the typical data flow for a `scan` command.
