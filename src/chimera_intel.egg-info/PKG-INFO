Chimera Intel is a command-line first OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to solve a critical business problem: **information fragmentation**. Inspired by the mythological Chimera—a creature forged from multiple animals—this tool synthesizes disparate data streams into a single, unified, and actionable dossier.

Chimera Intel is a **comprehensive Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity platform** designed for both **offensive intelligence gathering** and **defensive monitoring**.
It is a modular, extensible tool that allows cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and threat analysts to perform thorough reconnaissance on corporate, organizational, and personal digital footprints.

By combining multiple specialized modules—ranging from domain footprinting, web and business intelligence, to AI-driven analysis—Chimera Intel enables users to gather actionable insights efficiently.
It integrates various APIs, local scanning tools, and machine learning models to automate the collection, correlation, and analysis of large datasets, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy.

The platform is designed with **flexibility and modularity** in mind:
- Offensive modules provide detailed visibility into target infrastructure, public assets, and business-related data.
- Defensive modules allow organizations to monitor for potential breaches, data leaks, and malicious activity affecting their brand or digital assets.
- AI modules leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide predictive insights, anomaly detection, and strategic recommendations.

Chimera Intel is ideal for security researchers, OSINT enthusiasts, and IT teams looking to **strengthen their security posture**, **investigate incidents**, or **perform advanced competitive intelligence**.

## 📖 Use Cases & Example Workflows

Here are a few ways you can use Chimera Intel to gain actionable intelligence.

### Workflow 1: Competitor Analysis
Your goal is to build a complete dossier on a competitor, "megacorp.com".

1.  **Initial Footprint**: `chimera scan footprint megacorp.com -o megacorp.json`
2.  **Technology & Business Intel**: `chimera scan web megacorp.com` and `chimera scan business "MegaCorp Inc"`
3.  **Find Key People**: `chimera scan personnel emails megacorp.com`
4.  **Synthesize with AI**: `chimera analysis strategy megacorp.com`
5.  **Generate Report**: `chimera report pdf megacorp.json`

### Workflow 2: Continuous Self-Monitoring
You want to monitor your own company, "mycompany.com", for external threats.

1.  **Check for Breaches**: `chimera defensive checks breaches mycompany.com`
2.  **Look for Leaked Secrets**: `chimera defensive checks leaks "mycompany.com api_key"`
3.  **Discover Attack Surface**: `chimera defensive vuln run mycompany.com`
4.  **Monitor for Changes**: Set up a weekly cron job to run scans and use `chimera analysis diff run mycompany.com footprint` to get alerts on new subdomains.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher.
* `git` installed on your system.
* The `nmap` command-line tool (for the vulnerability scanner).
* A running Tor proxy (like the Tor Browser) for dark web searches.

### 2. Installation
It is highly recommended to install the tool within a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/chimera-intel.git](https://github.com/your-username/chimera-intel.git)
cd chimera-intel

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the project and all dependencies in editable mode
pip install -e .

Before running, copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in your API keys.
cp .env.example .env
# Now edit the .env file with your keys
nano .env

# Example: Install the 'footprint' scanning plugin
cd plugins/chimera_footprint
pip install -e .
cd ../..

# Example: Install the 'analysis' plugin suite
cd plugins/chimera_analysis
pip install -e .
cd ../..

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the tool from anywhere using the `chimera` command.

```bash
# Get help for any command
chimera --help
chimera scan --help

# Run a basic footprint scan on a domain and save the output
chimera scan footprint google.com --output google_footprint.json

# Check your own company's domain for data breaches
chimera defensive breaches mycompany.com

# Generate a SWOT analysis from a previously saved scan
chimera scan business "Microsoft" --ticker MSFT -o microsoft.json
chimera analysis core swot microsoft.json

### Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the typical data flow for a `scan` command.
